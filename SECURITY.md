If you believe you have found a security issue in SPH Report Cleanup, we encourage you to report it responsibly. Your proactive efforts help us strengthen the security and reliability of the project for everyone.

Please do **not** open a public issue for security matters. Instead, report any vulnerabilities privately to the project owner:
