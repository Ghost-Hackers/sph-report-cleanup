> ## Expected Behavior

<div align="justify">

  All participants are expected to be respectful, considerate, and inclusive in all interactions. Welcoming and inclusive language should be used at all times, and differing viewpoints and experiences should be valued. Constructive feedback should be accepted gracefully, and the focus should remain on what is best for the community. Empathy and kindness are essential, as is giving credit where due and acknowledging the work of others. Personal boundaries and privacy must be respected, and participants should always assume good intentions and seek clarification before escalating conflicts.

  We encourage open and honest communication, active listening, and a willingness to learn from one another. Participants should strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas and experiences.

</div>

> ## Unacceptable Behavior

<div align="justify">

  Unacceptable behaviors include harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form. This also covers the use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks. Public or private harassment, publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission, and sustained disruption of discussions, meetings, or events are not tolerated. Retaliation against individuals who report [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations is strictly prohibited. Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is also unacceptable.

  We do not tolerate any form of hate speech, including but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other form of discrimination. Participants should be mindful of their language and behavior, ensuring that it is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.

</div>

> ## Reporting & Enforcement

<div align="justify">

  If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by emailing us. Reports are confidential and will be handled promptly and fairly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and impartially. The project lead is responsible for enforcement and may consult trusted community members as needed. Actions may include warnings, temporary or permanent exclusion, or other appropriate responses. The project lead will maintain confidentiality and communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

> ## Scope

<div align="justify">

  This [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all project spaces, including online platforms, public events, private communications, and any situation where an individual is representing [SPH Report Cleanup](https://github.com/ghost-hackers/sph-report-cleanup) or its community, both online and offline.

  It also applies to all participants, including contributors, maintainers, organizers, and community members.

</div>

> ## Consequences

<div align="justify">

  Participants asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project lead may take any action deemed appropriate, including:

</div>

- Verbal or written warning
- Temporary or permanent removal from the community, events, or online spaces
- Reversal of contributions (e.g., code, comments, issues)
- Reporting to relevant authorities if required by law

> ## Appeals & Restorative Practices

<div align="justify">

  Anyone who is subject to or witnesses an enforcement action may appeal the decision by contacting the project lead. Appeals will be reviewed in good faith and may involve additional trusted community members. Where possible, restorative practices (such as mediation or facilitated discussion) may be offered to resolve conflicts and restore trust.

  Restorative practices aim to repair harm, rebuild relationships, and foster understanding among all parties involved. The goal is to create a supportive environment where everyone can learn from their mistakes and grow.

</div>

> ## Confidentiality & Privacy

<div align="justify">

  We take privacy and confidentiality seriously. All reports and enforcement actions will be handled with the utmost care to protect the identities of those involved. Information will only be shared with those who need to know to resolve the issue, and all parties will be treated with respect and dignity throughout the process.

  Participants are also expected to respect the privacy of others and not disclose personal information without consent. This includes respecting the confidentiality of discussions, reports, and enforcement actions.
