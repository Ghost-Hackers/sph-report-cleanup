> # SPH Report Cleanup

[![Greetings](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/sph-report-cleanup/actions/workflows/greetings.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/sph-report-cleanup/actions/workflows/greetings.yml)
[![Generate Changelog](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/sph-report-cleanup/actions/workflows/generate-changelog.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/sph-report-cleanup/actions/workflows/generate-changelog.yml)

**SPH Report Cleanup** is a Batch script designed to search for and clean up [Synxis Property Hub (SPH)](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/solutions/property-hub/) reports from the workstation's "Downloads" folder. This script features several enhancements for user convenience. It keeps itself and its dependencies up-to-date, ensuring a seamless experience.

The script employs a PowerShell script to find and delete SPH PDF files based on the predetermined search format: **"sph*.pdf"**. This specific format is chosen to safeguard against unintended deletion of non-SPH files. The script's sole purpose is to clean up residual report files in the "Downloads" folder, enhancing system hygiene.

> ## Getting Started

### Downloading

To begin using **SPH Report Cleanup**, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/sph-report-cleanup/releases/download/v0.1.0/SPH.Report.Cleanup.bat). The script is a standalone Batch file; no additional downloads are required. The script will handle the installation of necessary dependencies automatically upon execution.

### Installing

There is no installation process. The script will reside in the user's "Downloads" folder. While the script can be run from any location on the user's machine, it is recommended to move it to the desktop for easy access. The script creates a desktop shortcut with every run, ensuring an always up-to-date link.

> ## What To Expect When Running The Script

Upon running the script, it will perform the following tasks:

- Attempt to run as an administrator
  - If not granted administrative privileges, it will prompt for elevation, ensuring a one-time administrative session for necessary operations.
- Verify and install dependencies
  - Ensure proper functioning of the script.
- Check for updates
  - Download and install the latest version of the script and its dependencies, if available.
- Display a progress bar
  - Visualize the search for files matching the **"sph*.pdf"** format.
- List files to be deleted
  - Provide a preview of files targeted for deletion.
- Confirm file deletion
  - Prompt the user for confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.
- Display informational message
  - Showcase script details and offer options via buttons.
- Create a desktop shortcut
  - Facilitate easy script execution.
- Terminate the script
  - Exit after prompting the user to press any key.

> ## FAQ

1. **Why does the script need to be run manually?**
   - The script is designed for user-initiated execution and is not intended for automatic runs.

2. **Why does the script require Windows 10?**
   - It relies on PowerShell 5.1 or higher, exclusive to Windows 10.

3. **Why administrative privileges?**
   - Necessary for file deletion in the user's Downloads folder and for self-updating.

4. **Why run on a company machine?**
   - Tailored for Synxis Property Hub files, serving no purpose on other machines.

5. **Why run after downloading Synxis PDF files?**
   - Targets cleanup of downloaded SPH files; irrelevant otherwise.

6. **Automated script run?**
   - Possible via Windows Task Scheduler but not recommended due to unnecessary resource usage.

7. **Why check for updates?**
   - Ensures script and dependencies are current for optimal functionality.

8. **Different window during script run?**
   - CMD Prompt window used for progress display; background downloads may spawn a second window.

9. **Uninstall prompt during script run?**
   - Git uninstalling previous versions as part of the update process.

10. **"Cloning" or "pulling" message?**
    - Git fetching the latest script version during the update.

11. **Desktop run recommendation?**
    - Convenience feature; script can run from any location, but desktop placement is advised.
