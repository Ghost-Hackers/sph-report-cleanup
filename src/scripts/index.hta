    <h2>Description</h2>
    This script will only clean up your Downloads folder by removing all SPH reports via a secure deletion method after locating the PDF files left after printing the SPH Reports. It will also create a shortcut on your desktop to run the script again in the future for your convenience. It will check for updates to itself and its dependencies and install them if available. The script is not designed for, nor intended for, any other purpose. Our script is open source and is publicly available on GitHub by Ghost Hackers.
